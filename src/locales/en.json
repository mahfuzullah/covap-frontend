      "intro": "The AI algorithm we use is called CAMAP and was developed at the {IRIC} during Tariq Daouda's PhD. The original application for CAMAP was cancer immunotherapy. However, because it has learned general patterns about the immune system, CAMAP can also unveil virus weaknesses. These weaknesses are very small bits of viral proteins that infected cells present at their surface. These bits are called epitopes, and because these epitopes are like red flags waved by infected cells and then used by the immune system to fight the virus, they can be used in a vaccine. Epitope vaccines are also in theory safer because they do not contain the whole virus. CAMAP can help identify which of these epitopes will be useful to create a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",
